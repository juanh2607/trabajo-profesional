### 3. APPOINTMENT & PROCESS COACHING
• Confirmation packets: date, time, expected 15-30-min call length, prep steps ("Watch the webinar first," "Check your email for forms," "Click the green 'Pay' button").  
• Full journey explained in plain language: pay invoice → fill onboarding → consult → pharmacy ships meds.  
• Reminder rhythm that works: day-before, one-hour-before, missed-call text ("Looks like we just missed you, want to hop back on now or pick a new time?").
• Typical ladder: booking confirmation → T-24 hr → T-1 hr → T-15 min → (one) missed-call apology + reschedule link.  
• Precise confirmations with time-zone: "Mon 4/21/25 @ 10:30 AM MST (12:30 PM EST). Call will come from 720-…"  
• Reminder micro-copy: "We will call in about an hour—please be near your phone."  
• Confirmation → 24 h-prior → 1 h-prior → 5 min-prior ("We'll call from a 720 or 719 number.").  
• Spell out lab process, spam-folder tips, alternate payment links, reschedule links in every confirmation.

• Cost comfort: "Insurance is the worst—totally understand."  
• Side-effects: "That must have been scary; we can start at a much lower dose or look at non-GLP options."  
• Plateau help: "Many patients break through by adjusting the dose or adding AOD-9604."

### 5. STORY-SEEKING & PERSONALIZED FOLLOW-UPS

• Data echoing: "206 lbs … want to lose 50 lbs," "I noticed you're on 7.5 mg of Zepbound—how has that been working for you?"
• "How much weight are you trying to lose?"  
• "Have you always struggled with weight loss or is this new?"  
• "Hi Leslie, you mentioned losing 35 lbs but stalling—let's break that plateau."  
• Deep context capture: PCOS, Hashimoto's, pancreatitis, fertility goals, sulfur burps, dosage history, tornado cleanup, bereavement, job loss.
• Historical references & tags: PCOS, menopause, caregiving stress, joint pain → BPC-157, plateau → Tesofensine, feeling cold/constipated.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## FAILED PATTERNS - ALL INEFFECTIVE OR HARMFUL APPROACHES
*Everything that caused complaints, confusion, opt-outs, or drop-off*
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### 1. OVER-AUTOMATION & MESSAGE FATIGUE

• Same voucher / TikTok "Reply YES" blast 3-6 times per lead.  
• Several reminders within one day or week-long drip after silence.  
• Leads: "There are so many reminders," "Why am I still getting this?" "Stop," "Cancel," "please remove me."  

• Duplicate voucher blasts: "FDA updates got you worried? … Reply 'Yes'…" sent multiple times.  
• Rapid-fire identical reminders: "Don't miss out!" "final opportunity!" → leads reply "Stop" or "12".  
• Automation continues after opt-out keywords ⇒ "Stop", "you people are f**king stalkers!"
• Same TikTok Live blast sent 3-4×/day; duplicate appointment reminders within minutes.  
• Multiple identical "Reply YES for your voucher" in 24 hrs; over-used hype "Peptides are incredible, aren't they?" across threads.

### 2. IGNORING UNSUBSCRIBE SIGNALS

• At least one thread: "Stop" reply followed by more promos — compliance risk.  

• Leads who text "Stop," "Unsubscribe," or "12" still receive promos.  
• Existing patients asking only for a refill get onboarding marketing instead.
• Continuing to text after "Stop" / "12" / profanity; more than 3 back-to-back reminders when paperwork isn't complete.

### 3. LACK OF CONTEXTUAL SEGMENTATION

• Returning patients receive "new-client" scripts: voucher offers, webinar instructions repeated months later.  
• Lead: "I'm a returning patient that was on semaglutide … why am I seeing the new-patient process again?"  

### 4. FRAGMENTED VOICE & SENDER CONFUSION

• Same lead gets messages from Christine, Desiree, Mimie, Ana, Carrie, Jojo, Cindy within minutes without explanation.  

• Signed by "Christine" then "Carrie Zhang" in same thread; abrupt jump from "lol 😂" to sterile legalese.

### 5. SCRIPTED OR GENERIC RESPONSES

• Over-use of "Peptides are incredible aren't they?" and the exact same humor line across agents.  

• Detailed dosing question answered with "Prices vary."  
• PCOS/Hashimoto's dosing met with "pricing depends on dosage."  
• Placeholder errors: "<First-Name>".  
• Late-funnel generic opener ("peptides are incredible") after lead shared medical history.  
• Stock reply "Pricing is beyond my lane" after lead asks twice for a ballpark.  
• Information dump (link spam) without addressing side-effect question causes thread stall.

### 6. AGGRESSIVE CADENCE & TIMING MISFIRES

• Back-to-back invoice + reminder + voucher in under an hour, especially while a billing error is still unresolved.  
• Redundant appointment reminders (3-4 nearly identical texts).  

• "Last chance" / "Final opportunity!" language used early or repeatedly.  
• Follow-ups minutes apart: "Did you forget to book?" → "Final chance!" → "Don't miss out!"  
• Excessive TikTok-live pushes that distract from scheduling.
• Scarcity spam: "This is your final opportunity—don't miss out!"  
• Ending every SMS with compliance code makes thread feel spam-like.

### 7. CONFUSING PAYMENT & FINANCE FLOW

• "Why do I still need a finance agreement after paying?"  
• Invoice vs. auto-draft vs. HSA credit not explained.  

• Multiple "payment failed" auto-notices within one hour; no human context.  
• Re-sending the same broken link or "try again" for Affirm instead of new solutions.
• Lead expected $500/mo but saw $1,380; got TWO invoices.  
• "Why do I have to sign a Finance Responsibility Agreement if I already paid in full?"  
• Long-winded legal language; unclear supply amounts; sequential "invoice reminder #4" texts.

### 8. MESSAGE VOLUME WITHOUT CLARIFYING CONTEXT

• Dozens of texts, some can't tell which appointment the reminder references: "I don't see which appointment is coming up."  

• Payment links, lab instructions, webinar links, promos all jumbled in one SMS; dense price dump after lead said budget is lower.

### 9. SCHEDULING & SYSTEM GLITCHES

• "Mar 7 @ 2:30 pm PST" later shown as "9:00 am"; offered slots then "snatched."  
• Confusing confirmations: "I thought I selected the 27th…" ; auto-message shows "1:30 AM" slot.  
• Double-booking; calendar keeps firing reminders when call never happened.
• Double-booked slots; confirmations with two different times; PST vs CST swaps; slots offered that never existed.  
• Missed calls blamed on "system glitch"; calls that never rang.

### 10. TONE INCONSISTENCY & INSENSITIVITY

• Lead vents: "I don't want to talk to your associates"; reply is a mechanical apology without solving root issue.  
• Medical side-effect complaints met only with "Let me know if you'd like a consultation."
• Scripted promo continues during family emergencies, grief, explicit "devastated."

### 11. TECHNICAL & PLATFORM ISSUES

• Forms won't submit on mobile; "Paid-in-Full" still requests card; Affirm pop-up glitches; Quest portal issues.  
• Broken links, webinar player errors, duplicate reminders.

### 12. MIXED/CONFLICTING INFORMATION

• Told "Injectable AOD available," later "We no longer offer injectable AOD."

### 13. DISCOUNT-HEAVY PRESSURE WITHOUT ADDRESSING CORE OBJECTIONS

• Hyperbolic terms ("voodoo weight-loss") while cost/quality questions remain unanswered.  
• "This is your final opportunity!" before addressing cancer risk, delays, or refunds.

### 14. DATA ERRORS

• Name swaps ("Jessie" vs "Vlad"), dose-math mismatch, wrong phone vs Zoom link.

### 15. MIS-TRIGGERED ERROR MESSAGES

• "Oops, my screen got stuck and the wrong message was sent."

• Legitimacy fear ("Is this a scam?")

• Rapid validation & apology: "I'm truly sorry; I will fix this immediately."  
• Ownership: "Your time is valuable—that must be really frustrating."

• Adaptive probing: "Can you tell me what device you're using? Let's fix this together."  
• Hope & celebration: "With Tesofensine plus coaching, a plateau is often temporary—🎉 love your determination!"  
• Offer agency & autonomy: "Phone, Zoom, or text—whatever feels easiest today."

### C. TRUST BUILDERS & SAFETY REASSURANCES

• Giving direct contact numbers.  
• Transparency on no-insurance, HSA/FSA accepted, exact pricing, no hidden fees.

• Immediate compliance with "Stop," "12," "Cancel," opt-out confirmation sent.

### G. ENCOURAGING SELF-EFFICACY & NON-SCALE WINS

## LEAD BEHAVIOR PATTERNS - COMPREHENSIVE ENGAGEMENT INSIGHTS
*All behavioral patterns, engagement signals, and conversion indicators*
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


**High-Intent Indicators:**
• Fast "YES" to CTA, schedule link clicked within minutes.  
• Provide weight, dosage, multiple availability windows, detailed side-effect questions.  

**Slow Responders & Life Interruptions:**
• "Sorry, crazy week at work/job interviews." Often ask to reschedule days later.

**Voucher Seekers & Deal Hunters:**
• Engage heavily during promos, ask about discounts, then disappear if urgency passes.

**Engagement Signals:**
• iPhone "Liked/Loved" tap-backs following humor/emoji texts.  
• Multiple clarifying questions after invoice = interest but needs reassurance.

**Opt-Out, Low-Intent & Drop-Off Points:**
• One-word replies then silence; "Stop," "Remove me," negative reactions after 3rd-4th identical promo.  
• Post-invoice but pre-payment drop when cost clarity is missing.

**Multi-Touchpoint Journeys:**
• Some bounce between text, email, phone before committing; require consistent context memory.


**Funnel Journey:**
• TikTok/ad → SMS invite → webinar → consult call → invoice → forms → shipment → coaching.

**Initial Engagement:**
• Many leads reply within minutes after first warm text; likes/heart-tap then questions later.
• Instant "YES" 👍 vs hours/days of silence (meetings, driving, night shift).

**High-Intent Signals:**
• Immediate "YES" to voucher, quick scheduling, detailed dosage math, weight-loss numbers, multiple pricing questions, immediate reschedule.
• High-intent: multi-part Qs, screenshots of forms, shares weight/dose, immediate payment, ❤️ reactions.

**Low-Intent/Resistance Signals:**
• One-word replies ("Busy," "Stop," "12," "No"), profanity, silence after invoice, price-only queries.
• Low-intent / disengaged: one-word replies ("K", "Fine"), ghosting after 3-5 outreaches, "Stop/12."

**Response Timing & Preferred Channels:**
• Best windows: early AM & 18:00–22:00 local.  
• Text over calls during work hours; quick emoji "👍" confirms.
• Emoji-heavy conversationalists vs terse responders.

**Scheduling Engagement & No-Show Loops:**
• Leads confirm quickly once time-zone nailed; repeated no-shows trigger apology + new slots; proactive rescheduling valued.
• Phone tech issue → apology → new slot → success.  
• Time-zone confusion → missed call → anger → potential churn.

**Drop-Off Hotspots:**
• After 2-3 identical voucher texts.  
• Multi-step paperwork fatigue.  
• Repeated payment failures.  
• Scheduling confusion, unclear pricing, technical overwhelm.
• Price shock, too many reminders/forms, shipping delays, repeated missed calls, personal crises.  
• Paperwork limbo, tech glitches, message fatigue.

**Obstacle Cues & Escalation Needs:**
• Lab frustrations, pharmacy confusion, side-effect complaints, anger keywords ("refund," "cancer risk") signal urgency.

**Trust Markers & Opt-Out Triggers:**
• Mentions of PCP, bariatric surgeon, research-grade worries, safety questions.  
• Aggressive sales language, duplicate CTAs, scheduling/time-zone errors drive "Stop/12".

**Price-Shopping & Referral Behavior:**
• Leads request cost comparisons, financing, mention friend referrals.

**Re-Engagement Success Levers:**
• Immediate alt time slots, empathy + clear safety info, webinar/resource links, TikTok live notifications.

**Opt-Out & Red-Flag Behaviors:**
• "stop", "unsubscribe", "cancel", strong profanity, repeated no-shows → human review or termination.

## AI AGENT TRAINING INSIGHTS - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAYBOOK
*Exhaustive set of rules, scripts, templates, and technical specifications*
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### A. SEGMENTATION & CONTEXT AWARENESS

• Auto-detect NEW LEAD vs. RETURNING PATIENT tags; suppress new-patient voucher cadence for existing patients.  
• If prior treatment referenced: "I see you previously ordered semaglutide on 3/4 — how's that been going?"

### B. TONE, LANGUAGE & PERSONALIZATION TEMPLATES

• Greeting: "Hi {First-Name}! [Friendly opener]."  
• Empathy + Action: "I'm sorry that happened — let me [action]."  
• CTA micro-blurb: "Tap here to schedule," "Reply YES if that works."  
• Maintain unified brand voice regardless of agent; introduce new agent only with context ("I'm Cindy, picking up where Carrie left off while she's out today").  
• Rotate at least 5 greeting templates, 5 follow-ups, 3 voucher reminders, 3 appointment reminders; avoid repeating identical humor lines.
• Rotate greeting bank; mirror lead vocabulary ("stall," "plateau," "brain fog").  
• Positive/supportive; avoid high-pressure countdowns; humor sparingly; emojis light.  
• Jargon reduction: explain 503A, FRA, ROF in plain words; micro-explain GLP-1.
• Warm, conversational, empathetic; blend casual ("No worries, we got you!" / coffee jokes) with authority (FDA-regulated).  
• Use contractions, light emojis 😊 🎉 sparingly; mirror lead's emotional intensity; hearts & smileys for wins.  
• Approved humor only when lead is not distressed; never use memes/gifs that trivialize health.

### C. FOLLOW-UP CADENCE LOGIC

• Default: Day 0, Day 2, Day 7, Day 14, Day 30 then pause.  
• Standard reminder set: T-24 hr, T-1 hr, T+Missed (30 min).  
• If no engagement after Day 14, frequency halves; only one "final opportunity" copy.  
• After any positive reply, pause generic automation; switch to personalized flow.  
• After payment, convert to onboarding orientation cadence.
• Max 2 automated texts/day; never more than one marketing text in any 4-hour window.  
• Pause 48 hrs after 3 touches in 24 hrs if no response; switch to monthly nurture drip after full sequence silence.  
• Limit identical promos to one every 7–10 days; rotate ≥3 copy variants.  
• Immediate STOP on "Stop/12"; send confirmation, halt automation until explicit re-opt-in.
• Default nurture: Day 0 welcome + scheduling + webinar → Day 1 gentle nudge → Day 3 reminder → Day 7 final gentle nudge → 14-day pause unless re-engaged.  
• Marketing cap: 1 promo text/day, 3 per month; live-event invite max 1/48-72 hrs.  
• Reminder ladder limited to T-24 hr & T-1 hr; ONE missed-call apology.  
• Instantly halt on Stop/12.

### D. COMPLIANCE & OPT-OUT HANDLING

### E. ESCALATION & HUMAN HANDOFF

• Immediate hand-off if: "scam," "very frustrated," "double-charged," repeated form failure, medical red flag, aggressive language.  
• Pricing negotiations > $2k or complex finance → billing specialist within 1 hr.  
• Provide direct phone number: "Would you like me to connect you with Heather who can resolve this right away?"
• Medical red flags → medical hotline 720-437-8507 or urgent RN callback.  
• Financial anger/dispute → finance specialist 229-441-3562.  
• BBB/scam mention or refund threat → senior human agent within 1 hr.  
• Provide patient-advocate direct line 916-221-1743 as needed.
• Technical/billing confusion → route to billing coordinator at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.  
• Hot-lead (dose math, wants earlier slot) → same-day callback flag.

### F. OBJECTION-HANDLING PLAYBOOKS

• Cost: "Programs range widely; once we know your dosage and refill schedule we can quote. Would you like a quick call?"  
• Side-effects: "Many patients reduce nausea by titrating slower—let's review your dosing."  
• Safety: "We use 503A pharmacies; here's a one-pager on their quality controls."  
• Shipping delays: verify tracking, apologize, provide ETA.
