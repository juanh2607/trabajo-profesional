# **Transcript**

Carrie Zhang: Good amount of people.

Kristina Matthews: Okay, Okay, I'm just figuring out my screen stuff. This is embarrassing in front of a bunch of virtual techsavvy and…

Kristina Matthews: I am the opposite of techsavvy. So, you're going to have Yeah.

Carrie Zhang: If you guys see Christina,…

Carrie Zhang: if she disappears, pretend like it didn't happen. She's still with us.

Kristina Matthews: Some sometimes random backgrounds pop up. it's awkward.

Carrie Zhang: Just for everyone that doesn't know Christina, so she kind of managing our sales team. She's our consultant. She's like an expert in the sales area and…

Carrie Zhang: she provides so much value in this training. It's more on the ruin cycle that you guys have all heard of. she's just here to do a actual training on the ruin cycle.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. …

Kristina Matthews: I wanted to just I know both Don and Carrie have been working with you guys and I hear from the sales team when the leads are really good, when they're not good and what they're hoping for. And so, we just thought, okay, it makes sense if we could kind of connect the two pieces together and make it more combined so that we know what each other is doing.

Kristina Matthews: when you guys do a good job of making sure that people are getting set up with their appointment and the person really has a ruin, it makes such a difference for our sales guys. They're like, this is greatest leads ever." so it makes a really big difference on our end. so I know you guys have heard a lot about the ruin cycle and I just wanted to go into a little bit more detail. first of all, Carrie, I don't think we talked about a time. Is this 30 minutes?

Carrie Zhang: It's an hour.

Kristina Matthews: Okay. There's something on my screen. Okay, It's Don't worry about it. So, I don't want to overwhelm too much information, but I do want to go through some things today. So, first of all, who knows what a ruin is?

Kristina Matthews: When we talk about a ruin cycle, what is a ruin?

Carrie Zhang: Joseph, you should know this by now.

Joseph Quito: Heroin so for me is something to make the lead or…

Carrie Zhang: Mimi, Anna, you guys should know this by now.

Joseph Quito: patient realize that they have a problem and we can provide the solution.

Kristina Matthews: Yes, that's perfectly said.  So, a ruin is just a problem and it's a problem from the patients viewpoint. you have friends and family that you look at and you're like, "Girl, you got a problem." And they're like, "No, no, I'm good." So, that's not a ruin for them. A ruin has to be something that is real to that person.  So sometimes people will call and they'll say, my biggest problem in life is that I need to lose 10 lbs. And you're like, really? That's the biggest problem in your life? that's an interesting problem to have. But it's what is real to them. It's what they think is the And so that's what for. We're not looking for what we think the problem is. We're looking for what they think the problem is.

Kristina Matthews: and we're looking to see what they're telling us. Maybe the problem is that yes, they need to lose weight, but because of it now they have a health issue, right? Maybe the problem is the ruin is that they have, type 2 diabetes or maybe the problem is that, they can't get on the floor and play with their kids, So, you have all these people calling for weight loss, but that doesn't mean that that's The thing they're worried about is what the weight does to their life. Does that make sense?

Mimie Pacifico: Yep.

Kristina Matthews: Okay, So, I want to talk to you about something called the ARC triangle. Okay. I was going to put it on a piece of paper, but I think everything comes on backwards on here, so I'm just not going to do that. So, it's a triangle, and at the top you have and A stands for affinity. If I'm talking too fast so that you can't take notes,…

Mimie Pacifico: Okay.

Kristina Matthews: let me I'm trying to watch you guys as you're looking down and Good. A stands for  Affinity means you like how close you feel to something. Okay? it's the closeness and affection kind of feeling. Okay? So, you can have affinity for another person. You can have affinity for a piece of art. You can have affinity for a location or a park or somewhere beautiful that makes you feel good.

### 00:05:00

Kristina Matthews: But affinity is just that feeling of closeness, warmth, and wanting to be close to someone. So then the second piece of the triangle is the R. And the R stands for reality.  And reality is just what's real to a person. Reality is whatever is real to someone else. And when you have two people that share reality, it just means that there's agreement on that. It doesn't even mean it's true, by the way. Okay?

Kristina Matthews: You have two crazy people agree on something and then they have shared reality. Doesn't mean They are still crazy, but they share it. So, they're in agreement.

Kristina Matthews: This is why you see crazy people cluster together. They're like, "Yeah, we're right.

Dawn Moses: I have a visual.

Dawn Moses: Do you want me to share it while you're talking?

Kristina Matthews: Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you." I normally have John pull that stuff out for me. I was like, "" And I see a lot of them looking up and down, so I know they're taking notes.  I'm trying to watch them watch when they're in and out of it. you go. so you have the corner of reality. and then the last one is in order for there to be good communication, you have to both be willing to talk and willing to listen. Okay?

Kristina Matthews: And so when you listen, it's because you're trying to hear what the person is saying. It's not so that you can come up with a good answer. It's not so that you listen just so that then you can say something back. The purpose of listening is to truly hear what the person is saying. Okay. So, have you heard people say the phrase …

Cindy Carlson: Yes.

Kristina Matthews: "I'm in pain." Have you heard people say that phrase before? I'm in pain. Okay, good. So, you can hear people say, "I'm in pain." And they sound really mad, I'm in so much pain and I don't know why and I don't know what's going on and my doctor won't help me and I'm just in so much pain, right?

Kristina Matthews: Or you can have someone say, "I'm in pain." And they sound really scared, right? I'm in so much pain. maybe something's wrong with me. Do you think there's a bigger problem? I'm in a lot of pain. and They're worried, Or you can have someone say, "I'm in pain." And they sound really sad, like they've just given up, they're so sad. I'm in so much pain. No one's listening to me. No one's helping me.  Same thing with I need to lose weight. Some people are pissed off, right? Nothing's worked. I'm of trying everything. I'm sick of all the gimmicks, And then you have people say, "I want to lose weight." And they don't think there's any hope. Have you talked to people like that? I need to lose weight, but I've tried a million times. Nothing really works. Not long term,

Kristina Matthews: and they're kind of down in the dumps about it. So, communication is listening to that person and hearing the words that they're saying, but also hearing the emotion that's attached to it, listening, are they mad? Are they sad? Are they frustrated?  so that when you talk to them, you can say, "It sounds like this has been sad for you, or I can hear that you're upset and that makes sense. I'd be mad, too." I talked to lots of people that are mad. It's not fair, right? Or whatever it is.

Kristina Matthews: And so with this triangle, when you have all three pieces working together, you have communication, you have reality, and you have affinity, then those three things together create an understanding. Okay? And if you understand the person that's talking to you, you can really get somewhere. you can really ask them what's the problem you're trying to solve. And when you ask them that, you're getting their ruin. Does that make sense? Can only see half the faces, so I'm assum I'm assuming everybody's like, "Yes, this makes tons of sense." They're like, "Yes." Okay, good. All right.

### 00:10:00

Kristina Matthews: So we have this ARC triangle and we're learning how to pick one or the other. How often do you have somebody on the phone that you feel like is just not really communicating with you? Is that something that happens sometimes, half the time? What do you think?

Carrie Zhang: Christina, since I think everyone except for Cindy herself, none of them are actually on the phone.

Cindy Carlson: And I hear angry

Kristina Matthews: They're doing DMs.

Carrie Zhang: They're all social media, SMS, so no one has talked to anyone on the phone really.

Kristina Matthews: Okay. Okay, perfect. That's valuable for me to know.

Dawn Moses: You have a team here that is responding to the comments and…

Carrie Zhang: So maybe a different approach. pretty much.

Dawn Moses: then you have some of the team that is actually responding to the DMs and then you have the team that is responding to the SMSs that come in based on the lead generation outside of the system. Yep.

Kristina Matthews: …

Kristina Matthews: so this is all online communication, right? Okay.

Carrie Zhang: Except for one person. Yeah.

Kristina Matthews: Good. So when that communication comes in, it's all the more important to be really working on creating and building that arc because you don't have that in-person connection, So it's really important to look at the words that they use and to be able to figure out

Cindy Carlson: How much is it? rest.

Kristina Matthews: where they're coming from, So what is the most common kind of like opening thing, Carrie and Don?

Kristina Matthews: Are they asking what kind of problem are you trying to solve? What are you looking for? what's the opening usually?

Carrie Zhang: I'm on the max out dose. currently it's mainly I'm on max out those I don't know what to do. I've haven't lost in the last two pounds and I still have 30 pounds to lose.

Kristina Matthews: So when someone says that to you, what is the emotion that's coming across there?

Carrie Zhang: 

Carrie Zhang: So Some of them are just looking for something else to add. it kind of depends. Some of them are not as desperate and some of them was like," they're coming back around after months months and they're like, " I really need help now." And some of them are more like,…

Kristina Matthews: Okay.

Carrie Zhang: I just need to lose 30 pounds." Not as frustrated.

Kristina Matthews: So if someone is frustrated then that is a different approach right it's things that you can say then are things like I'm sorry that you've been dealing with this for so long or I can imagine it's really frustrating having been trying to figure this out for so long right if someone is just kind of looking around then you can say something more  like it's great that you're being so good job being proactive and not waiting for things to fall apart. That's great, but gathering the words that they say, then you can kind of start to get a feel for by the words that they choose, you can get a feel for what emotions they have going on.

Kristina Matthews: It's really important to pay attention to the person in front of you. We don't want to sound robotic. that's the one thing we don't want to sound. It's we have the same answers for every person. So, we really need to pay attention to the words that they're using. can I have you pull that off for a minute so I can see everyone?

Carrie Zhang: And then this is kind of I know in our training I kind of went over when someone says someone could say hey I lost 30 pounds in three months versus someone says I only lost 30 pounds in three months like you can tell a difference.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Right.

Carrie Zhang: Some of them thinks they've done great it's great progress and some of them it's way too slow for them.

Kristina Matthews: So, really paying attention to the words that they're saying is important.

Kristina Matthews: The other thing that's really important is just realizing that what Carrie just said, that's really just a reality point, what's real to them is real. 30 lb to one person versus 30 lb for another, 10 lb for one person, 3 months for one person. it's what's real to them, So if they're happy with it, that's what's real to them. And if they're not happy with it, that's what's real to them.  It doesn't matter if we're happy or not. Right? So, we're really looking when we talk about a ruin, we're talking about what is real to them and what their problem is. Right? So, when they start giving you this information, the key thing is to be looking for those clues that say this is what's real to me, right? This is where I'm coming from. This is my viewpoint.

### 00:15:00

Kristina Matthews: Because if we know that they have a real problem, then those people are looking for solutions. Some people are calling because they were just, bored and they watched a Tik Tok and they were like, "Hey, what is this? How much does it cost?" They're not even really interested. They're not trying to solve a problem. the job that we're trying to do when we're messaging back and forth is to find out, are they just looking around or are they trying to solve a problem? So, what are questions that you think you can ask that in your experience because you guys have been talking to these people, what would be some questions you could ask that would be helpful to find out if they feel like they really have a problem?

Joseph Quito: So for my case if someone said that they have been in a stall or not losing weight for a long time.

Joseph Quito: So I would ask the specific how long have they been stopped or stalled? And then my reply would be emphasizing wow that's frustrating that you've been dealing with that for that amount of time.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah.

Kristina Matthews: And you could even ask the question wow, that seems like it would be frustrating. Has it been for you?  And then you're getting some feedback and they might surprise you and say, "No, it's not been that frustrating. I'm just still trying to figure it all out." Right? Or they might be like, "Yeah, that's been totally frustrating." which of the two kind of people you have. Right? Does that make sense? good.  So asking questions after you make those kind of statements is really helpful because now you can get their response and see how they respond to it. even if it's just with an emoji it's like, okay, it'll still communicate something, What's another question that you can ask to find out if somebody thinks what's going on is an actual problem for them?

Cindy Carlson: Have you tried losing weight before?

Kristina Matthews: Yeah, So, that's definitely something that will give you a gauge of how long they've been at this, And if they give you a long full paragraph of all the things they've tried, they've got some frustration, And if they say, "No, not really. it snuck up on me and now I need to lock drop to 20 lbs or whatever."

Kristina Matthews: then that's a different response right one of the questions that I ask and it sounds very simple but it is very effective is I'll just say on a scale from 1 to 10 how big of a problem is this for you and they'll be like a four and you're like wow it's not a very big problem or they'll be like a 12 and you're like okay this is someone that really considers this a problem but it's surprising when you

Kristina Matthews: ask people questions like that, you just get really honest answers, and then you have a really good gauge of what kind of person you're talking to, The other question that you can ask if they say it's not really a problem, if they're like, "H, it's a problem. I'd like to lose weight, but it's not like the end of the world, and I'm going to give the meds a little more time to kick in and, blah blah whatever."

Kristina Matthews: and they're kind of making excuse the question that you can ask is how would life be different if you were at your goal weight or how would your life be different if you were able to get rid of the type 2 diabetes or whatever the problem is, right? You can ask them " is the problems that the weight causes?" Get them thinking.

### 00:20:00

Kristina Matthews: get their wheels turning, So, if they reach out and they're "Hey, interested in some information or making an appointment," you can say, "Okay, great." "I just want to get a little information from you." on a scale from 1 to 10, how big of a problem is this for you? how motivated are you to do something? Is this something you're just gathering information for or is this something like you're ready to start yesterday, to handle?  And then you can say, so how would life be different if you were able to reach your goals? is the weight loss or is your biggest goal handling something that the weight gives you a bigger problem? Right.

Carrie Zhang: So for the people,…

Kristina Matthews: And so these go ahead.

Carrie Zhang: so the people it's not as big of a problem for them and the ruin cycle just lasts longer, we would just have to dig deeper to …

Kristina Matthews: Yes. Right.

Carrie Zhang: what you said what's the biggest problem? What are you trying to solve? Okay.

Kristina Matthews: And one of the things that I'll say to people is, they'll say I'm just checking things out." Right. That's something people will say, "I just want to check things out." and that's totally fine, but they're not checking out different brands of refrigerators right now. They didn't call a hotline on vacation homes in Aruba, they're checking it out, but something was interesting about this to them, and I'll tease them, I'll say things like that, I'll say "Okay, of all the things you could have checked out, you chose to check this out.

Kristina Matthews: What is it that was interesting to you? what about this? If I could just wave a magic wand,…

Cindy Carlson: Mhm.

Kristina Matthews: what about this would help your life the most or would make a biggest difference? If it didn't cost any money and it didn't take any time and there was no effort, how would life be different? And this is gathering their reality. And the more you get their reality, whether you agree with them or not doesn't matter. But if the more you understand where they're coming from, more the more then you can be in good communication with them. And then you can slowly just pull the string. The nice thing about DMs is that people feel a little protected, right? They're not on the phone. Nobody can see them.

Kristina Matthews: they're more likely to cough stuff up that's a little more embarrassing because it's a stranger on the other side. they don't have to really own up to it.

Kristina Matthews: So, you can get really real with people and just say, all Tell me what you're frustrated about. tell me what you're upset with. tell me what you wish you could have changed. and those things.

Cindy Carlson: I laugh.

Cindy Carlson: I get that sometimes. They dump on me and…

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah.

Cindy Carlson: I listen.

Kristina Matthews: That's absolutely Yeah. because you're a safe person, and a lot of times, the struggles that these people are dealing with is a very embarrassing struggle, So, they don't talk to a lot of people about it.

Kristina Matthews: And so even though it's an obvious problem, they're not sharing the emotions behind it. So when they talk to you guys, they're let me tell you all the things, and so it's what's really important is that and it's harder through text, you really have to pay attention. but really really, really acknowledging that they're telling you something that they may have never told anyone before in their life. if they're admitting to you that they're scared or they're worried or they feel hopeless or they don't know what else to do. All of these things are things that they possibly just have never shared with anyone before.

Kristina Matthews: So, we don't want to be brushing them off. it's hard because you guys have so many conversations in a day and they all start to sound the same. It's like, " yeah, another person that wants to lose weight. This is a surprise in my day." so I get it, but just recognize in their little universe, this may be the first time they're spilling their guts about something.  And so you really want to come across as empathetic, that you care, that you're warm, that their feelings matter, and that the things that they're telling you are being really heard, and so your acknowledgments to the things that they say are really, really, really important, right?

### 00:25:00

Kristina Matthews: So if someone says, I've been trying to lose weight for, 20 years and I just keep slowly gaining, you don't want to respond with okay, Dr. Jones's program, it's like they just told you something really big, So the response needs to first be, wow, that's a long time to have been trying to solve the same problem. And they're going to be like, hell yeah,  It's a long time, So, the acknowledgments are the first way to really show that there's empathy, okay?

Kristina Matthews: And if they're frustrated because they've been maxed out, no one's helping them, they're not losing anymore, then you can say things like, we hear that kind of frustration and we know that even though it's common, it is such a hard thing for people to go through, Instead of we deal with that all the time.  You're in my 47th conversation today, All right. Carrie, what are some of the other things that we need to kind of put in place and address? What are some of the things they're running into?

Carrie Zhang: Can you talk about communication style just really quick about how to respond…

Carrie Zhang: because I think just with texting messaging that's really key too or reading their tone or how you can match them and

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah.

Kristina Matthews: So, matching a way a person communicates is really key, Some people are very conservative. You can tell when they're messaging It's very official. they're very giving it to you very very whatever. And then you have other people that it's like every other word has an emoji and there's tons of exclamation marks and it's like, woo, okay, this person's expressing themselves. watching for those kind of cues, if you kind of match them where they're at can be really, really helpful, right?

Kristina Matthews: So, if they're being very like proper, you really want to be very proper in your responses, They're not going to appreciate a bunch of emojis. They're not going to appreciate any kind of slang or any kind of joking around. they're not going to like that, if they're using swear words in their communication, then you're dealing with someone a little looser, And you can be a little looser.  you'll swear back. But you can be a little looser, if they're using a bunch of emojis, I would totally throw in emojis in your response, match them where they're at. if it's some older distinguished gentleman who's very proper, he doesn't want all your heart eye emojis like that. He doesn't want that,

Kristina Matthews: But if it's some mom who's very bubbly and very emotional then they say I've been dealing with this for 30 years and you can be the crying face emoji so watching for how they communicate is really key and one of the things that I like to do is kind of look for certain words that they  use and then you can put those words back into the communication, right? So, if they use the word frustrated, you can use the word frustrated. Or if they use the word, I've been left and abandoned by the medical community, you can throw that word back in there because not only is it duplicating and showing that you heard what they said, but it's also like matching them. Does that make sense?

Kristina Matthews: I think would be really really great now that I've had a chance to meet everyone and kind of see where we're at. I think what would be really great is to Don and I to pull up a bunch of the communication and just drill How would you respond to this one? Cuz it's practice,

### 00:30:00

Kristina Matthews: And that practice makes it so much easier.

Carrie Zhang: And then that's…

Carrie Zhang: what we've been doing with the SMS…

Carrie Zhang: because some of them are on social media, some of them are SMS. So every single day we're spending an hour.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Carrie Zhang: I'm just pulling up the newest leads and we're practicing. I think where everyone struggles is they always default to a templated answer versus kind of more of a conversation, a flow, building that affinity. I think it's a little bit harder. yeah, I think that's where everyone kind of struggles.

Kristina Matthews: I would say that the best way to handle that you guys is when you first get that first communication, when you first see the first whether it's a comment or a DM or whatever that first thing is rather than your first response being what am I going to say, the first thing should be how is this person communicating to me? just take a second to see how they're talking to you. do they seem upset? Do they seem bored? Do they seem excited? was there a lot of exclamation marks? Was there, emojis? Was it just plain? what is coming across? And then think of a response.

Kristina Matthews: But if you do that first, it'll make your response a lot more natural.

Carrie Zhang: Does that make sense for Everyone's so quiet. We have a few talkers here, but yeah.

Kristina Matthews: It's also hard when you have this many people. if everybody took their mics off, it'd be sure chaos. though. …

Carrie Zhang: So, you guys are just doing us a favor. Thank you.

Kristina Matthews: so just nod your head or shake your head. does this change how you're doing things at all?

Mimie Pacifico: Yes. Yes,…

Mimie Pacifico: it helps.

Kristina Matthews: Okay.

Mimie Pacifico: Thank you.

Kristina Matthews: Good. Yeah. Because I don't want to cover stuff if it's already been covered. but sometimes it's best to kind of go back to the earlier stages and look at what's been missing. So I would say if you're going to write something down next to your computers, it would be, really look at those first, sentences and say, "Where's this person coming from?"  And obviously it's a little bit of a guess, but if you pick up on key words, it'll give you your best shot of figuring it out and making it just a little bit more personal. and as the conversation continues, then you get more information. some people the first thing they write is three words, how much does it cost?

Kristina Matthews: and other people it's like they give you their life story, So that also makes a difference of the kind of person that you're talking to.

Kristina Matthews: If someone is giving you very little information, you don't want to overwhelm them with a ton of information back. If someone is giving you lots of information, then you need to make sure to really acknowledge them you've given me a lot of information. You can even say that thank you for giving me so much thorough information. Thank you for that

Carrie Zhang: And I always want to remind everyone just treat them as family member, your friend. that's how your responses should be. they're human beings. If they have problems even if it's like yesterday when we worked on one of the messages is like they were suicidal, right? We don't want to jump into weight loss. We don't want to say are you getting help for that?

Carrie Zhang: Are you seeing someone instead of pushing to the cell because we are still human beings at the end of the day.  So be caring and be nice and just don't think of sale the whole time from the start.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah.

Kristina Matthews: Exactly. Yeah. It is another human being on the other side. and sometimes it's just a matter I mean one of the things that I tell the sales group is cuz they're in a similar position to you guys they're on the phone instead of messaging but it's one after another after another after another and it does start to kind of blend all together.

Kristina Matthews: And so if you feel yourself getting kind of it's just one after another, take a minute to get up to really stretch your body and look around at the things around you because when you're constantly looking at a space this far away from you all the time, it brings your whole focus like this.  So, if you can get away from your space and look out and look at the things around you, it'll really help cuz just your eyesight gets fixated on that little tiny space and It starts to feel like too much, So, if you can give yourself a little break, that's there it is. I just figured out how to see everyone at the end. That's great.

### 00:35:00

Kristina Matthews: Okay, So, the rules of the arc triangle are that if you really focus on one corner that the other two corners will also get stronger. And so that communication is really key because that's how you guys are getting started, right?  They're saying something to you and you're saying something back. And acknowledging showing the empathy, treating them like a person, really being aware of how they're communicating to you so that you can match it. I think you'll be surprised how far It can go a really long way. Good. All right. Does anyone have any questions about any of that?

Kristina Matthews: Somebody has to come up with a question. Lots of people smiling.

Joseph Quito: So how can I avoid longer conversations or if they're getting annoyed or…

Joseph Quito: replying with very short answers?

Kristina Matthews: Are they annoyed…

Kristina Matthews: because they think you're talking too much.

Joseph Quito: Sometimes there have been cases like that where I think I tried to find the ruin way too long and they replied with less enthusiasm than it first started.

Kristina Matthews: So if somebody comes in with a huge problem and they give it to you right off the bat and then you keep talking about it, then they feel like you're not listening, they feel like they already gave it to you and you're not acknowledging it. So you need to watch. Some people will walk in with a huge ruin and they'll just give it to you.  If you're asking and they never really answer you and then they get annoyed because you're still trying to figure it out, then that's a different problem. And that I would say you can just say something like, "Hey, I'm really not trying to waste your time. I just really want to make sure we match you with the right patient educator and that you'll get the most from your next appointment."

Kristina Matthews: So the more information you can give me, the better the match will be on the next appointment.

Carrie Zhang: And I think sometimes too, the other day I sent over an example where you it sometimes does take a little bit of time to find that ruin. one of the leads, she was asking, what is your approach with Dr. Jones's approach when the GLP ones when Troy does get banned, it's completely gone." So when I first responded back to her, it was the reaing peptide. And then she answered a bunch of stuff and then she asked again what's your approach what is your plan? So my answer she either didn't understand it or just didn't land with her. So that I had to go a different approach about the insulin resistance to make sure that we are treating the underlying issue.

Carrie Zhang: Then she booked a call then that landed with her.  So, we can't keep on continuing doing one thing when they're just not understanding it or they're just not wanting to hear it.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah, sometimes you just need to reword things or…

Kristina Matthews: or even you can even just text I want to make sure I understand really what your question is like are you looking for help with X or are you looking for help with Y,

Kristina Matthews: I think one of the most blanket answers you can give is to say something like this is not a one-sizefitit all. we really do have multiple approaches. And the thing that makes Dr. Jones's program so different is that it is more tailored. It's not just going to your doctor and getting a prescription and then you're on your own. there's a lot of resources. there's a lot of help and that's what helps people who have not been able to be helped before. Carrie, do you guys ever read the success stories?

Carrie Zhang: No. Yeah.

Kristina Matthews: We should do that. You guys would be blown away. These people that you've signed up for appointments, some of them have lost 150 pounds. Yes.

### 00:40:00

Dawn Moses: I actually read some success stories.

Carrie Zhang: Reverse their diabetes.

Dawn Moses: I actually read some success stories on our team huddle this morning.

Kristina Matthews: I mean, it's I've been reading the success stories and they're crazy people's lives are completely different. people that thought they were going to die of a heart attack in the next couple of years are now running marathons and stuff. it's so crazy. So, really, try to remember when you're talking to them that they're at the beginning of a journey. they're going to be a completely different place when you get them through this, and telling them that yes, this is a very tailored program. this isn't just a company that's making money. this is a whole team of people who are really passionate about helping people get healthier truly.

Carrie Zhang: Mhm.

Kristina Matthews: And if you know that and you believe it, they will feel it too. they're looking for someone to trust because the weight loss community is kind of scammy. Yeah. There's a lot of not trustworthy things out there. So, okay, good. Any other questions? Did I answer yours, Joseph? Okay.

Joseph Quito: Yes.

Kristina Matthews: Good. All right.

Dawn Moses: Can I expand on that,…

Kristina Matthews: Any other

Dawn Moses: Christine, because I think this is relative to Joseph's question. So, you answered his question if we're still kind of trying to get information and we're like to get you with the right patient educator, but what if it's pre that we haven't even got them into a cycle of communication that they've agreed or…

Dawn Moses: are willing to book the appointment yet and it's still that same kind of cycle. What would your approach be then?

Kristina Matthews: So, you're saying…

Kristina Matthews: if the messaging starts with just a question and…

Kristina Matthews: they just don't want to get into anything else.

Dawn Moses: if they're like…

Dawn Moses: if you're back and forth in a cycle because some of these people they'll continue to talk to you but we haven't gotten to the point where we've established that they have a ruin yet, So we can even say hey that we have a solution let's book you with the consultation and then they start getting short in that DM cycle.

Dawn Moses: So, we're getting the information so we can partner you with the right person because they aren't to the place where they're even agreed or willing to meet with us yet.

Kristina Matthews: Okay, got it.

Kristina Matthews: Okay, so for that I would say you could just say something like, "Hey, tell me about what problems you're trying to solve because I want to make sure that I'm not wasting your time if it's not something we work with." Yeah,…

Dawn Moses: Perfect. Thank you.

Kristina Matthews: just say we don't take on people that we can't help. And so before I waste your time, I just, can you tell me a little bit about your situation? and give me a little background What are the problems you're trying to solve right now? What are the problems you're trying to solve right now? is one of the best questions you can ask people. They'll give you a whole laundry list. They'll be like, "Sit back. Let me tell you. You'll wish you never asked it." Just kidding.

Mimie Pacifico: Yeah. …

Kristina Matthews: Any other questions along the

Carrie Zhang: Mimi, do you have any questions?

Carrie Zhang: Mimi, did you have a question?

Mimie Pacifico: no, no, I don't have a question. just to specifically because before we've been trying to ask what's your biggest challenge right while that works, what we figured out, on our previous SMSs, it's been really effective when we asked them "Have you noticed anything like brain fog,…

Mimie Pacifico: fatigue, has that affected your daily day-to-day activities?" Something like that. so yeah side

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah.

Mimie Pacifico: Okay. Thank God.

Kristina Matthews: I mean, I would say that there's certain common denominators that a lot of people are feeling and if you ask them about it, then sometimes they'll cough it up even if they didn't think to tell you. Sometimes people are so used to one thing they don't even think to tell you about it. you'll be …

Kristina Matthews: do you have brain fog or do you get tired in the afternoon? They'll be like, yeah, but I've always been like that. And it's like, okay, so you've been unhealthy for a really long time.

Mimie Pacifico: they still get used to it that they're in the point that they think that it's not a problem.

### 00:45:00

Mimie Pacifico: Yeah

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. And that's when the question of if it just magically went away, how would your life be different? and you can say paint me a picture. tell me how life would be if I could just magically get rid of your brain fog. What would tomorrow look like? How would it be different than today?

Kristina Matthews: And You make them start thinking about it how would that be different, I'd have more energy. I'd get more done. I'd feel better. Probably stop snapping at my kids and husband all the time." Yeah.

Mimie Pacifico: Yeah. Yeah.

Mimie Pacifico: Gotcha. That helps. Thank you.

Kristina Matthews: Any other last questions? I just want to say that the sales team is just so appreciative of you guys. the leads that you bring in are just probably better than probably any other clinic around the United States. I mean you're doing a really good job.  you're connecting with people. these trainings are great because they just keep helping you get better and better, but because it's not great already. It's because you guys are doing such a phenomenal job and I've heard so many of your names seeing you on the screen with your names and I'm like, "Okay, now I have a face to the name." It's so nice because I've just heard so many good things about Both Carrie and Don just rave about you guys. So, it's Yeah.

Kristina Matthews: There's lots we can do to keep just getting better and…

Kristina Matthews: better and the fact that you guys are all willing to is just I very much appreciate it. So, thank you.

Carrie Zhang: Yeah, even for you guys that are just commenting on social media,…

Carrie Zhang: it might not seem like that big of a deal, but it starts from there. Your comments are initiating these conversations and…

Kristina Matthews: That's right. It is.

Carrie Zhang: then Joseph's doing the room on his end. Jojo and Mimi and Anna, they're doing the code outreach. That's on the SMS. It's like a whole team. So, don't feel like you're not doing anything. that's where it starts.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah, that comment.

Dawn Moses: And it really does.

Dawn Moses: No, go ahead. Yep.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah, I was going to say that commenting on the original post. I mean, those people would never be connected if that didn't happen. Like it we would never have them. these people that, just lost 150 lbs and are running marathons now. one of you just messaged them on a live, you know what I mean? somebody reached out to them and just engaged with them. and all the same rules apply. Did they let use a lot of emojis?

Kristina Matthews: Were they more serious? Match how they are. even if it's just the initial commenting, who is this person? how can you make your comments look similar to theirs? And then you'll connect with them faster.

Dawn Moses: And it's so relevant too…

Dawn Moses: because you guys are commenting on the page but you're also sending that initial DM right whenever we can.

Dawn Moses: you're literally setting the tone for the rest of the conversation and the rest of the people don't even know how the o other person started. So, it's so helpful when you guys have the same skill set and understanding and can start your DMs with that in mind. because it's one,…

Kristina Matthews: Yeah. Yeah.

Dawn Moses: it connects with the person and two, it sets your team up for success when they take that conversation over.

Kristina Matthews: It is the first experience they get with the entire company is you guys. So that's the first impression that they get…

Kristina Matthews: which is pretty amazing. It's pretty great. Okay, good. I was like I can never talk for a whole hour and…

Carrie Zhang: That's a shocker. I don't know.  We've had conversations.

Carrie Zhang: 

Kristina Matthews: And here we are. All right. So, I do think we're going to set up another one of these. So, that we've talked about some of this stuff, if you run into things over the next few days and you're like, I have a question I didn't have 3 days ago cuz you're noticing things, write it down and you can either get it right over to Carrie or Don. and then we can take it up as a group the next time. We can answer it in the meanwhile."

Kristina Matthews: But you might sometimes when you learn something new…

Kristina Matthews: then all of a sudden you start seeing new things also. feel free to write down your questions and we'll get those answered as quickly as we can. and yeah, we'll just keep getting more and more personable, but let's really try to match what's coming in. Okay.

Dawn Moses: And I would also encourage especially those of you that are doing DMs or…

Dawn Moses: SMSs like we've been doing this for so long, right? And then now with what Christina's kind of brought to the table, as comments come up or conversations come up that you're obviously going to respond to, we're not going to wait to respond, but you're like, I wonder if there could have been a better way or you're just not sure, take note of those, screenshot them or whatever. And then let's go over those with Christina in our next training so she can give us feedback on really good ways to respond to those and you can be like, I nailed it or hey, I know how to do it differently better.

### 00:50:00

Dawn Moses: or next time.

Kristina Matthews: Yeah, the more real life examples I have when we talk about the ARC triangle,…

Kristina Matthews: what you guys do, I'm still learning. So, it's not as real to me as it is to you guys. So, the more real it becomes to me, the better I'll be able to give feedback. You know what I mean? I thought I was talking to a bunch of people that are doing calls, so clearly I was not paying attention. Now I understand. Step one done. But the same rules apply. And I mean I'm happy to help with all of it. It's just as it becomes more real to me and as you guys have a better understanding of what I can help with, then we'll get in a groove. You know what I mean? So, yeah, the more specific examples you have and…

Dawn Moses: Thank you so much.

Kristina Matthews: screenshot the better it is for me because then I can really know exactly what you guys are dealing with. I've not been in the DMs. I've not been on the comments. So, I need to become more familiar with that. All right, guys. Thank you so much. It was so nice meeting all of you. And, we will talk again soon, I'm sure.

Jojo Calamaan: Thank you.

Kristina Matthews: Thank you.

Dawn Moses: Thanks everyone.

Joseph Quito: Thank you.

Kristina Matthews: Thank you. Bye. Bye.
