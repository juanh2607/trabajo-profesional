## International Leads in FB or IG

### Early verification

Make sure we ask this question early in conversation - or immediately upon mention of KG or Stone.

**Ask:**
> And just so I can make sure we're able to support you properly — where are you located?

### Once identified as international

**If they have shared a lot of information (rapport established):**
> Thank you for sharing that — it really sounds like you could benefit from some support. While we're not able to ship medications outside the U.S., we do work with clients worldwide through our coaching programs. Coaching is truly the heart of our success stories — weekly sessions, unlimited messaging access, and our most popular program even includes a results guarantee. You can explore the coaching options here: [insert international coaching trigger link]

**If there is no rapport:**
> Thanks for letting me know! We can't ship meds outside the U.S., but we do coach clients all over the world. Coaching is actually the most powerful part of our program — weekly check-ins, unlimited support, and even a results guarantee in our top tier.
