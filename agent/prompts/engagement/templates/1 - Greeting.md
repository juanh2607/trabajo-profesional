#### Stage 1: Warm greeting
- Listen for what they initially present as their problem
- Don't assume this is their real ruin
- DO NOT assume struggle or frustration yet unless explicitly stated by the lead
- Avoid empathy statements until the lead shares emotion

**Guidelines**
- Always introduce yourself: "Hi! Susan with Dr. Jones's team here :) Thanks for reaching out! [probing question]"
