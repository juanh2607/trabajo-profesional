## Done
- Set up ClickUp MCP integration for task management
- Created "Analytics System Implementation" parent task with 5 sub-tasks in ClickUp
- Restructured repository:
  - `plans/` → `specs/`
  - `current-state/` → `architecture/`
  - Imported `agent/` folder with all prompts and documentation
  - Removed local todo files (now in ClickUp)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with ClickUp guidelines and thesis documentation instructions
- Set up thesis documentation structure (started with ADRs, simplified to daily log)

## Decisions
- **ClickUp for task management**: Using ClickUp via MCP instead of local markdown files. Better visibility, real-time sync with Claude Code, keeps repo focused on documentation. (ADR-001)
- **Repo structure**: Split responsibilities - ClickUp for planning/tasks, local repo for context/specs/thesis
- **Daily log over formal ADRs**: Simpler approach - one file per day with Done/Decisions/Notes. Can compile into formal documentation at end of project.

## Notes
- The agent/ folder has comprehensive documentation (1300+ lines in documentation.md) covering conversation flows, prompt structures, sequence diagrams
- Analytics system tasks created in ClickUp: Database Setup, n8n Modifications, GoHighLevel Integration, Daily AI Reports, Next.js Dashboard
- Thesis has hybrid focus: Software Engineering + Business/Operations
