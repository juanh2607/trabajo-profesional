## Done
- Set up ClickUp MCP integration for task management
- Created "Analytics System Implementation" parent task with 5 sub-tasks in ClickUp
- Restructured repository:
  - `plans/` → `specs/`
  - `current-state/` → `architecture/`
  - Imported `agent/` folder with all prompts and documentation
  - Removed local todo files (now in ClickUp)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with ClickUp guidelines and thesis documentation instructions
- Set up thesis documentation structure (started with ADRs, simplified to daily log)

## Decisions
- **ClickUp for task management**: Using ClickUp via MCP instead of local markdown files. Better visibility, real-time sync with Claude Code, keeps repo focused on documentation. (ADR-001)
- **Repo structure**: Split responsibilities - ClickUp for planning/tasks, local repo for context/specs/thesis
- **Daily log over formal ADRs**: Simpler approach - one file per day with Done/Decisions/Notes. Can compile into formal documentation at end of project.

## Notes
- The agent/ folder has comprehensive documentation (1300+ lines in documentation.md) covering conversation flows, prompt structures, sequence diagrams
- Analytics system tasks created in ClickUp: Database Setup, n8n Modifications, GoHighLevel Integration, Daily AI Reports, Next.js Dashboard
- Thesis has hybrid focus: Software Engineering + Business/Operations
- Agent handles multiple services: Weight Loss (main), BHRT, Healing Peptides, Cognitive Peptides, Growth Hormone Peptides, International leads
- Conversation has 4 stages: Greeting → Discovery (Ruin + Probable Cause) → Solution → Booking
- 4 probable causes tracked: Metabolism Slowdown, Medication Desensitization, Hormone Imbalance, Insulin Resistance

## Session 2: Metrics Expansion

### Done
- Reviewed agent documentation to identify additional metrics
- Expanded metrics-spec.md from 14 to 27 metrics
- Updated ClickUp task with new metrics and fixed file paths

### Decisions
- **Service type tracking**: Track conversations by service interest (WL vs BHRT vs other peptides) to understand market demand
- **Stage funnel metrics**: Track drop-off at each conversation stage to identify bottlenecks
- **Sub-agent performance**: Track each specialist agent's invocation count and hand-off rate to find knowledge gaps

### Notes
- New metric categories: Service & Conversation (15-18), Medical Context (19-21), Escalation (22-23), Sub-Agent Performance (24-27)
- These metrics will help identify where the agent struggles and where to focus improvements
